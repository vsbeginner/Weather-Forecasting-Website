#  Weather Forecasting Website

A **dynamic weather forecasting web application** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** that provides real-time weather data for any location in the world.

The application integrates with the **OpenWeatherMap API** to fetch and display weather conditions, allowing users to search for a city or automatically detect their current location to view weather information.

---

#  Project Overview

The Weather Forecasting Website enables users to quickly check weather conditions for any city, state, or country.

Users can:

* Search weather data for a specific location
* View weather forecasts for multiple days
* Detect and display weather for their **current location**
* Handle invalid inputs gracefully
* Interact with a clean and responsive interface

The goal of this project is to demonstrate:

* **API integration using JavaScript**
* **Dynamic DOM manipulation**
* **Handling asynchronous requests**
* **Geolocation API usage**
* **User-friendly UI design**

---

#  Problem Statement

Weather applications are commonly used tools that rely on **external APIs and real-time data processing**.

Many beginner projects focus only on static interfaces and do not integrate live data sources.

This project solves that by building a **dynamic weather application** that:

* Fetches real-time weather information
* Allows location-based queries
* Handles user input validation
* Uses browser geolocation services

---

#  Solution Approach

The application uses the **OpenWeatherMap API** to fetch weather information based on user input or the user’s current location.

The workflow involves:

1. Capturing user input (city/state/country)
2. Sending an API request to OpenWeatherMap
3. Processing the JSON response
4. Dynamically updating the UI with weather information

Additionally, the **Geolocation API** is used to detect the user's current coordinates and fetch weather data for that location.

---

#  Key Features

###  Location-Based Search

Users can enter a **city, state, or country name** to retrieve weather data.

###  Current Location Weather

Users can click **Use Current Location** to automatically fetch weather data based on their device location.

###  Multi-Day Weather Forecast

Displays weather conditions for the **current day and the previous 5 days**.

###  Error Handling

If the user enters an invalid location:

* An alert message appears
* The system notifies that coordinates are not available

###  Geolocation Permission Handling

When using current location:

* Browser asks for location permission
* If allowed → weather data is displayed
* If blocked → alert appears explaining that geolocation access is required

###  Responsive Interface

Built with CSS to ensure the UI remains clean and readable across devices.

# Project Demo

#  Usage

1️⃣ Enter a **city, state, or country name** in the search field

2️⃣ Click the **Search** button

3️⃣ View weather data for the selected location

OR

1️⃣ Click **Use Current Location**

2️⃣ Allow location access when prompted

3️⃣ View weather data for your current location

---

#  Example Output

The application displays:

* Temperature
* Weather conditions
* Location name
* Multi-day forecast

Example:

```
Location: London
Temperature: 18°C
Condition: Cloudy
Humidity: 72%
Wind Speed: 10 km/h
```

#  Challenges & Learnings

### API Integration

Fetching and handling data from the **OpenWeatherMap API** required understanding asynchronous JavaScript and API response handling.

### Geolocation Permissions

Handling cases where users allow or deny location access was important for ensuring smooth user experience.

### Error Handling

Validating user input and managing incorrect location queries helped improve application reliability.

#  Future Improvements

Potential enhancements for the project:

* Add **7-day weather forecast**
* Implement **search history**
* Display **weather icons and animations**
* Add **temperature unit toggle (°C / °F)**
* Deploy the project using **GitHub Pages**
* Implement **mobile-first responsive design**
